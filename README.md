# example

I'll add this line with a regular merge commit

I'll add this line with a squash commit on merge

And this third line in another commit within the same PR

Here's a fourth line I'll use squash and merge on as well, with a single commit

Here's a fifth line I'll use rebase merge with

And a sixth line I've added in a new commit on the same fifth PR.
